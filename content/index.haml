        Our system packages a gateway, user interface and intelligent routing system. At a high level, it controls the workflow of applications via modules, directs messages to and from applications and maintains a list of applications and user sessions, linking the two. It's a highly modular system. We've created numerous modules for our own purposes, and can customize the system for your needs. _The system makes it easy to create complex message flow._
        * Built-in modules for opt-in, opt-out &amp; help
        * Associate keywords in exact match and 'starts with' modes for robust sub-keywords
        * Support for multiple SMSCs, through SMPP binds or web services
        * Long-numbers available for threaded messaging &amp; and staging
        * Session and state awareness for true two-way messaging
        * Advanced subscription management
        * Flexible keyword matching &amp; selective routing
        * Wide range of "API functions (opens API documentation page)":/api
        * *Everything built from the ground up for "real applications (our projects)":http://holmesmobile.com/projects* - we eat our own dogfood
