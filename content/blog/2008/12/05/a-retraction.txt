The folks over at "Woobius":https://www.woobius.com/ have offered their sincere apology over what I believe was a simple misunderstanding and have made several changes to their blog design in response to my last post. I appreciate the professional way that they have handled the situation and have decided to retract said post in response to their request.
<% end %>
<%= @page.excerpt %>

I am not changing my stance on whether or not my design and content are open source and open to reuse (they are not). I will include a more explicit license to try to prevent such issues in the future. I would very much like to keep my blog's source publicly viewable on Github. I may need to discuss with the Github team the legal implications of their TOS(Terms of Service) for public repositories.

I would also like to find a licensing solution that would allow me to open certain parts of the source (my customizations of Webby and the various helpers and tools in my @lib@ directory, for instance) but still allow me to keep the design and content proprietary. I welcome any suggestions in the comment section below.

I wish the Woobius team the best and look forward to seeing the direction that they take with their blog now that this misunderstanding has been cleared up. I hereby officially remove their evildoer status and downgrade them to unfortunate-misunderstanding-doers. I have also called off my Lawyers of Justice.
