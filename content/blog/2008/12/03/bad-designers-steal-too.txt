summary:    Wherein our hero faces his gravest challenge yet. Beware, evildoers are surely lurking&#8230; wherever it is that evildoers usually lurk.
excerpt: 		'<p class="first"><span class="dropcap y">Y</span>ou
might have heard the phrase, "Good designers copy, great designers steal." Pablo Picasso said it &mdash; and most people seem to think that he knew something about design. In fact, Cameron Moll wrote a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/copy-great-designers-steal/" title="Good Designers Copy, Great Designers Steal [Design Principles]">nice article</a> that goes into just what Picasso might have meant. Here&apos;s a little secret: bad designers steal too. Now, I&apos;m not the first designer to have their work ripped off. I suppose that in some strange way it could be considered some sort of mark of passage. That doesn&apos;t mean that I have to enjoy it.</p>'

The evildoer in this case is "Woobius.com":http://www.woobius.com/scribbles. I suggest that anyone with a spare minute go and leave a polite, helpful comment "here"://www.woobius.com/scribbles/posts/0004-design-stress-therapy.html#disqus_thread, possibly one that is instructive as to where exactly he can go shove his blog design.

On a more whimsical note, I found this snippet from "his css file":http://www.woobius.com/scribbles/css/site.css to be rather entertaining:
