h1. Send Subscription Message (send_subscription_message)

Sends a message to the application subscribers. The message is split into multiple parts using the preferred application splitting mode automatically.

If the list of tags is given, subscribers with these tags are chosen. If no tag is specified, all subscribers receive the message.

If the time in the "on" field is given the call operates in the scheduling mode. It schedules a message to be sent to the application subscribers in a future. The message text will be split and otherwise processed as in the usual subscription message sending. The date of the message sending has to be tomorrow or later. The date can contain the suggested time and the application will use it as a guidance. The message is guaranteed to not be sent before this time, but can be sent later. The messages are supposed to be sent in batches periodically during the day (currently every two hours). The format of the date may vary from very strict "10/12/2008 12:55AM -0500" to the relaxed "Tuesday 9 1:15PM". If the timezone isn't specified, the EST (GMT-5) is assumed.


Parameters:

* api_key       - (String) mandatory API Key
* body          - (String) message text
* on            - (String, Optional) time when the message is to be sent
* tags          - (String, Optional) comma-separated list of tags
* description   - (String, Optional) description of this message or any other info that you want to save

Responses:

* HTTP Code 500 and error message in the body
* HTTP Code 200 with JSON hash (text/javascript)
** If immediate subscription message:
*** recipient_count - number of recipients that received the message (only if it wasn't a scheduled message)



h1. Cancel Subscription Messages (cancel_subscription_messages)
