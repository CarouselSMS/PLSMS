Service Layer, when it takes care of the subscription management (Subscription Module is enabled for the application), consumes all messages related to the subscription cycle, such as STOP, SUB, Y and others. In order to still let the application know and react to subscription / cancellation events, we provide convenient callbacks.

h1. Subscription Created (subscription_created)

This callback is performed when a new subscription is created. The application may decide that this particular subscription has to be tagged in some way. If it does, the comma-separated list of tags can be returned as the HTTP response to this callback request. Tags can contain spaces, letters, digits, '-' and '_' characters.

Parameters:

* type = subscription_created
* phone_number - phone number of a new subscriber

Responses:

* Empty response if no tagging is required
* Comma-separated list of tags to assign to the corresponding subscription record


h1. Subscription Canceled (subscription_canceled)

This is invoked when a user decides to unsubscribe from the application.

Parameters:

* type = subscription_canceled
* phone_number - phone number of the unsubscribed user
