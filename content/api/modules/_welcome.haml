Welcome module is intended to send Welcome responses to the first-time users of SMSCs or applications.

This module works on two levels: SMSCs and Applications. In most cases, responses belong to a specific application and they will be passing through the application-level module. In rare cases, when the message is not associated with any application, the module of the SMSC it came through will be working with it.

This module doesn't stop the processing of the message. It sends the welcome message (if entered) in addition to the further processing which may or may not result in any additional messages.

Configuration:

* Welcome text message - the message to send. If the message is not given, the module is inactive. The message field can be found on the application and SMSC edit page in the administrative console.
