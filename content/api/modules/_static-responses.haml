Static responses module provides an extremely flexible feature -- automated responses to certain keywords -- to client applications or SMSCs in general. Static responses are stored in the table where keywords are associated with responses.

When MO arrives, its contents are checked against the table associated with the target application (or with SMSC it came through if no application is currently associated with the phone number). If the message finds its response, the client application never receives it, but instead the MT is sent automatically.

An application or SMSC can have any number of static responses that can be registered through the application (or SMSC) details page. Every message can have the Free flag set which means that the response has to be sent as an FTEU message.

Configuration:

* Keyword-Response pairs can be entered on the application / SMSC details page
